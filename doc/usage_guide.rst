Using `afqbrowser`
========================

After installing the software, you can run the program on mat files generated by
`AFQ`_. For an example, download this `mat file <https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ-Browser/raw/master/afqbrowser/site/client/data/afq.mat>`_, change your working directory to the location where the file was
downloaded to, or move the file to your current working directory and run::

    afqbrowser-assemble afq.mat
    afqbrowser-run

Open a browser pointing to `http://localhost:8080 <http://localhost:80080>` ,
to view the visualization of these data and to interact with it. The variables in the metadata table are created based on the variables that are stored in the `mat file <https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ/wiki#including-subject-metadata-in-the-afq-structure>`_ of the afq.mat file.

Publishing your website
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a command line function that allows you to publish your website to
Github. If you don't already have one, start by `creating a Github account <https://github.com/join>. Then run the following sequence::

    afqbrowser-assemble   # Run this if you haven't before
    afqbrowser-publish -t ./AFQ-Browser -r myresults

Where `./AFQ-Browser` is the folder that was created by `afqbrowser-assemble`,
and the URL of the website is: `https://username.github.io/myresults` (with
`username` replaced with your Github username, and `myresults` replaced with the
input to the `-r` flag).
